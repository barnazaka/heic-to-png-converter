HEIC to PNG Conversion with Decentralized Storage and Compute
This project is a bounty submission that combines Acurast's image conversion functionality with Cere Network's decentralized data storage capabilities. The main objective is to create a simple web application that converts HEIC files to PNG files, storing both original and converted images in Cere's decentralized storage network and using Acurast for the image processing.

Summary
This bounty project implements a fully decentralized HEIC-to-PNG image conversion system. The application allows users to:

Upload a HEIC image to a public bucket in Cere Network.
Convert the HEIC file to PNG using Acurast's compute functionality.
Store the resulting PNG in the same Cere bucket.
Provide a downloadable or shareable link for the converted PNG file.
Expected Result
Create a developer account on the Cere Developer Console.
Create a public bucket in Cere Network using the developer console.
Build a simple web interface with a file browser and a "Convert" button.
Allow the user to:
Upload a HEIC file to the Cere bucket.
Press the "Convert" button to send the HEIC file to Acurast for conversion.
Receive the converted PNG stored back in the Cere bucket, with a link to download or share the file.
Project Setup and Requirements
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
npm install
Create a Cere Developer Account and Bucket:

Register at the Cere Developer Console.
Create a new project and a public bucket, noting the bucket ID for later use.
Configure Environment Variables:

Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory:
bash
Copy code
CERE_USER_SEED="your-seed-phrase"
CLUSTER_ID="your-cluster-id"
BUCKET_ID="your-bucket-id"
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This starts the local server and opens a tunnel for accessing the Acurast cloud functions.

Usage
Upload HEIC File: Navigate to the application’s file browser and select a HEIC file to upload.
Convert: Click the "Convert" button to trigger the conversion. This uploads the file to Cere, sends it to Acurast for processing, and stores the resulting PNG in the Cere bucket.
Download: Once the conversion completes, a link to the PNG file will be generated for download or sharing.
